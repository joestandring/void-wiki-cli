# void-wiki-cli
This is a fork of [@deadhead420]("https://github.com/deadhead420/arch-wiki")'s neat arch-wiki script altered for use with the [Void Linux Wiki](https://wiki.voidlinux.org/Main_Page ).
## Installation
Simply clone this repo and allow running of the script:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/joestandring/void-wiki-cli
$ cd void-wiki-cli
$ chmod +x void_wiki.sh
```
## Useage
Run the script on its own to be taken to the Void Wiki main page (boring!):
```
./void_wiki.sh
```
Or if you're feeling more adventurous, follow it with a search term!:
```
./void_wiki.sh vim
```
These commands will open the wiki in whatever you have set as $BROWSER, or will default to one of a number of text based browsers.
